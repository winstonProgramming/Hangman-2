<h1 align="center">Hangman-2</h1>

<p>"Hangman-2" is a one player game.</p>

<p>I built Hangman-2 at the Cary, NC Scrapyard by Hack Club. This was a 36 hour Hackathon where the theme was to code something "stupid". I programmed Hangman-2 because I wanted to take a popular game and make it 100 times more annoying. I won first place.</p>
