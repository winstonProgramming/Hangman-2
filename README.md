<h1 align="center">Hangman-2</h1>

<p>"Hangman-2" is a one player game based off of Hangman. The only difference is that, in Hangman-2, there is no preset word - it constantly changes based on the letter guessed by the player. Develop strategies and work your way through the levels. Good luck!</p>

<p>I built Hangman-2 at the Cary, NC Scrapyard by Hack Club. This was a 36 hour Hackathon where the theme was to code something "stupid". I programmed Hangman-2 because I wanted to take a popular game and make it 100 times more annoying. I won first place using python with modules like ? for the words database and custom tkinter for the UI.</p>
